### Hi there 👋, I'm Suzanne
#### I am a Frontend Developer
I can work both frontend and backend, but I really enjoy the design side of things. My background is a combination of web dev, graphic design, business ops, and education. 

Skills: React / Node / Express / HTML / CSS / Sass

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my portfolio design scheme 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects for fun (WoW addons anyone?) or non-profits 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a Tolkien nerd and I love gardening. Basically a hobbit.
