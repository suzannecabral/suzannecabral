### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Suzanne
#### I am a Full Stack Web Developer
I can work both frontend and backend, but I really enjoy the design side of things. My background is a combination of web dev, graphic design, business ops, and education. 

Skills: React / Redux / Node / Express / Python / Django

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on launching my portfolio site
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects for fun (WoW addons anyone?) or non-profits 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a Tolkien nerd and I love gardening. Basically a hobbit.
