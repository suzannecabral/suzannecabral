### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Suzanne
#### I am a Frontend Developer
I've studied full stack development and have a background in education and graphic design. I also have a strong interest in product design with respect to the intersection of UX, accessibility and visual design.

Skills: React / Node / Express / HTML / CSS / Sass

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Open-source projects for fun (WoW addons anyone?) or non-profits 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a Tolkien nerd and I love gardening. Basically a hobbit.
